# A Rust rewrite of the COSC 310 final project
The project was chaos, and I don't like Java. So I'm gonna redo it in Rust.



## Important
The human(🤸) genome is written in DNA(🐢), and as we all know 🧠 DNA(🐢) is very memory unsafe 🤢⚠ and unperformant 🐢. Not to mention 🙊 that the human(🤸) genome wasn't written ✏ with any computer 🖥 supervision ⚠ for 1.8 million 😱 years ⚠⚠🤮! No automated safety checks 📋 or anything! Which brings me to the conclusion; we need to rewrite ✏ the human(🤸) genome in Rust(🚀). Rust(🚀) is blazingly 🚀 fast 🚀, and memory ✅ safe 🚀, too 🚀. Rewriting the human(🤸) genome 🚀🚀 in Rust(🚀) will prevent humans 🤸 from encountering 👾 cancer 😱 (undefined behavior ❌) or from sneezing or coughing 🤧😒 (buffering ⏳) 🚀🚀🚀🚀. Not to mention 🚀 🙊🙊🙊 that humans(🤸) will become immortal 🚀 because 💁 there will be no more 😱 death ‼ (segmentation faults). Thank you 😊 for coming 🙇 to my TED talk 🧸.
